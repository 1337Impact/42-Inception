# inception

A 42School project for working with docker 

During this Project I learned how to build, run and manage multible containers using docker and docker-compose

The project is simple:
 - you need to create three containers (nginx, wordpress and mariabs)
 - each container must handle one working process
 - running `make` must build and run the containers
 - only the NGINX container is accessible using port 443
